# List of Matrix types and namespaces
A public list of Matrix (matrix.org) namespaces and types for events, states, and fields. This list does NOT include official Matrix namespaces; for that, refer to the [Matrix spec](https://spec.matrix.org). Furthermore, this list does NOT endorse or recommend any items listed.

Add your entry to the alphabetical position *of the namespace/ID itself* in the list below, following the precedent that has been set. If you have more than 5 of a field in one namespace, or more than 2 in more than one list, add or move the fields under your namespace instead to the Namespaces section and link to another page with all of your namespaces. Feel free to add a file to this repository to list your namespace fields.

File issues for any complaints or suggestions with the formatting of the list, and file a PR to add, remove, or update an item.

## Events
* [`com.example.message`](https://example.com/matrix/message.txt) ([schema](https://example.com/matrix/message.schema.json)): A message readable by example.com. <!-- Keep this one at the top, remove it when there are three or more event entries that follow the pattern. -->

## Room states
* [`com.example.pronouns/<user_id>`](https://example.com/matrix/pronouns.txt) ([schema](https://example.com/matrix/pronouns.schema.json)): A set of pronouns for a user, according to example.com's definition. <!-- Keep this one at the top, remove it when there are three or more event entries that follow the pattern. -->

## Namespaces
The following namespaces contain fields documented elsewhere.
* [`uno.online.*`](https://online.uno/matrix): An example of a namespaces list entry for an online Uno game.
